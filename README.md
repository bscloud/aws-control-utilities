## AWS SDK for Go

We have a pilot redesign of the [AWS SDK for Go API reference documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/api/gosdk-apiref.html). Let us know what you think.


## Installing

Use `go get` to retrieve the SDK to add it to your `GOPATH` workspace, or
project's Go module dependencies.

	go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go

To update the SDK use `go get -u` to retrieve the latest version of the SDK.

	go get -u github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go

## Reference Documentation

[`Getting Started Guide`](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/) - This document
is a general introduction on how to configure and make requests with the SDK.
If this is your first time using the SDK, this documentation and the API
documentation will help you get started. This document focuses on the syntax
and behavior of the SDK. The [Service Developer
Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/) will help you get started using
specific AWS services.

[`SDK API Reference
Documentation`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/) - Use this
document to look up all API operation input and output parameters for AWS
services supported by the SDK. The API reference also includes documentation of
the SDK, and examples how to using the SDK, service client API operations, and
API operation require parameters.

[`Service Developer Guide`](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/) - Use this
documentation to learn how to interface with AWS services. These guides are
great for getting started with a service, or when looking for more 
information about a service. While this document is not required for coding, 
services may supply helpful samples to look out for.

[`SDK Examples`](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/tree/master/example) -
Included in the SDK's repo are several hand crafted examples using the SDK
features and AWS services.
